    > You'll create a registration form and confirmation page
    

    > create boilerplate in index.html
    > then create a form element which will contain inputs
    > inside the form, add the following inputs, with each on its own line
    > 1. A text input 
    > 2. A password input
    > 3. A select input
    > 4. A submit input (button)

    > Next add the following labels to the inputs, linking them with "for" attributes
    > 1. Username
    > 2. Password
    > 3. Gender

    > Almost done!

    > Now create a second file in this directory called "second.html", and add boilerplate
    > 1. Add the "success.png" image (from this directory) into the body of "second.html"
    > 2. Also, add a <button> that links back to "index.html" (hint: relative path)

    > Lastly, go back to your form, and change it to link to "second.html" on submit!
    > Now you have a working form and confirmation page!
